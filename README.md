# acid_patch_detection_robot

The robot developed in this project is capable of scanning a grid, in this case a 2x3 grid, for acidic patches inside each block. The acidic presence in this demonstration is represented by black/dark patches. The robot enters the grid from either end and scans each block for the dark patches. It records the position and number of those patches. As soon as the scan is complete the robot diplays the output on a 16x2 LCD as well as sends the results continuously through the serial port.

The detailed report of this project is attached herewith.
